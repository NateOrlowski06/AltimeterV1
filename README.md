## Overview
This is a personal project with the goal of learning how to write code for a rocketry payload. 
The payload includes a Raspberry Pi 4, a BMP180 pressure sensor, and a BNO055 absolute orientation sensor.
The Raspberry Pi is powered by a 2s LiPo in series with a buck converter. 
The electronics are mounted on a custom bracket inside the rocket designed in CAD and 3D printed.

## Launches
The first launch is on my L1 rocket so that I can get as many test launches as possible. 

The remaining launches will be on my L2 rocket, Tempest, to much higher altitudes and more space in the payload section
