This is a personal project with the goal of learning how to write code for a rocketry payload. 
The payload includes a Raspberry Pi 4, a BMP180 pressure sensor, and a BNO055 absolute orientation sensor.
The Raspberry Pi is powered by a 2s LiPo in series with a buck converter. 
The electronics are mounted on a custom bracket inside the rocket designed in CAD and 3D printed.
